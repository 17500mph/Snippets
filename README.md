If u like to have clean and nice CSS, the sample file for **[CSSComb](https://github.com/Ski-lleR/Snippets/wiki/Rules-for-CSSComb)** is for you.

With more than 15 property category, the result file can be big after parsing, but for dev it's cool because you can read all the style very quickly. And minifying the file with library like csso before moving to prod and it's perfect :)

After parsing :

In case you like to have a well arranged music library, i suggest you the **[Renaming script for MusicBrainz Picard](https://github.com/Ski-lleR/Snippets/wiki/Renaming-script-for-MusicBrainz-Picard)**.

You have the possibility to arrange root folder with last.fm category OR alphabetical folder.

There is multiple settings to help you to have your file arranged like you want.
